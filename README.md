## Introduction

This Simple Shell project is a command-line interpreter developed as a part of our ALX Software engineeringProgram. It is designed to demonstrate our understanding of fundamental concepts in C programming, including process management, system calls, and basic user interaction. It serves as a basic Unix-like shell that allows users to execute simple commands and provides a minimal shell experience.

## Project Description


This shell is a basic shell that prints a prompt, waits for user to enter command, handles user input and executes basic shell commands. It provides the following functionalities:
- Displays a simple prompt (where 'prompt' is a customizable string; e.g., debs_george$ for this project).
- Accepts one-word commands from the user and executes them.
- Handles errors gracefully, including displaying an error message for command not found.
- Closes the shell when the "end of file" condition is encountered.
- Provides a clean and minimalistic shell experience without advanced features.
